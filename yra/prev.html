                            CBIT Model United Nations conducted its 10th edition from 7th-9th May 2021. Owing to the pandemic and considering everyone's health, the conference was held in an online capacity for the first time since its inception. To accommodate 280 delegates from India, Kazakhstan, and Colombia, 5 top-notch International and Indian committees had been simulated. The opening ceremony was attended by over 450 people.

                            The ninth edition, conducted from 20th to the 22nd of September 2019, went on to become one of the finest editions with an outstanding delegate count of 250. The venue being the prestigious Chaitanya Bharathi Institute of Technology, instilled a sense of home in the minds of the delegates and the Organizing Committee. The quality of the Executive Board grabbed attention from throughout India and stood out as the showstopper of the edition.

                            The eighth edition, conducted from 31st August-2nd September 2018 with the theme “Indelible Imprint” surely did leave an imprint behind- not just on the delegates who attended the conference but also on every person associated with it. This particular edition stands out from the rest with two successful events under the Social Responsibility Department. With the scenic beauty of the venue- Hotel Marigold, 7 amazing committees with extremely intriguing agendas had a considerable turnout of around 300 delegates.

The quality of the executive board was incomparable and increased participation from the delegates just added to it. Two international delegations made their way to the conference from Afghanistan, Bangladesh. With its seventh edition, CBITMUN continued to rewrite history by growing bigger and better.

                            With a delegate count of over 310 at CBITMUN 2016 and a footfall of almost 500 people, the 6th edition had etched itself a niche of its own. But the delegate count wasn't all that it had offered. It withheld the traditions and stayed loyal to the roots of the club. After 5 successful editions, such a feat is beyond praise. Every year, our club comes up with innovative ways of improving the culture of MUNs and with every edition we have scaled up the standards in terms of magnitude and class.

                            The 5th edition of CBITMUN was held in August, 2015 and was arguably the biggest of the lot, attracting over 300 delegates from all over India-the highest number of delegates to ever attend an MUN in Hyderabad. The accommodation and hospitality partner for CBITMUN’15 was the Marriott Hotel and Convention Centre. As a part of the Training Team Initiative we had been to Future Kid's School. CBITMUN’15 had the plantation drive in college and a day was spent at Om Sai Sevashram under the Social Responsibility Department.

                            The third edition was hosted from 5-8th September, 2013. The feature that set this conference apart was the expansion of the conference to other spheres pertaining to MUNs in particular and society in general, that is taking up initiatives to train School students or contribute to the society through the Social Responsibility Division. With a top notch venue, Golkonda resorts, this conference had more than 250 delegates participating in an intense debate.

                            CBITMUN was first held in 2011. It was a four day event and attracted over 250 delegates from not only India, but also from over 25 different countries worldwide. The first edition of CBITMUN was surely a trendsetter for all future student organized conferences and introduced the concept of an MUN in Hyderabad. This edition took place in the world class conference facilities of Mahindra Satyam Learning world and was certified by The United Nations Information Centre for India and Bhutan, an official representative of the UN.
